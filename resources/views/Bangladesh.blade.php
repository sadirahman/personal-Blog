  <strong>HISTORY: </strong><br>
  Bangladesh has a glorious history; it lies on the eastern fringe of the Indian 
  Sub-Continent. The people of Bengal have always been great lovers of freedom. 
  As a result, the land nearly always enjoyed a fair degree of sovereignty during 
  its entire history, sometimes as one state and sometimes as several, with only 
  perfunctory allegiance to the central ruling powers. In the 18th century Bengal 
  became a part of the British Empire. In 1947, when the subcontinent was divided 
  into Pakistan and India, it became eastern part of Pakistan.<br>

  and Bangladesh became an independent, sovereign country in 1971.<br>
